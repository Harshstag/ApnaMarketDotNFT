# Market basic actions

You can **create** (mint) new tokens, uploading their image and metadata on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) using [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/).  
If you've created or bought an NFT, you may also **sell** it by setting a price and paying a listing fee.  
When **buying** an NFT, the price will be transferred to the seller and the listing fee to the NFT Marketplace owner.  
It's also possible to **cancel** a market item, transferring it back to the owner.

# Lean NFTs Visualization

There are three pages to view NFT marketplace :

- **Market Page- Marketplace**

Shows all NFTs that are available to be bought.  
This page will show NFTs even if the user doesn't have the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) extension or isn't connected to the dapp.
